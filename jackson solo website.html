		<h3>Sustainability in my School Community</h3>
		<p>Sustainability is an issue within my school as we have a large issue with litter and as we are near the beach much of that litter gets taken by the wind and is put into the ocean causing enviornmental sustainability to be very difficult.</p>

        <h2>What Can we do to Keep Enviornmental Sustainability?</h2>
        <p>There are a few things that the school could do to ensure better enviornmental sustainability and those include:</p>
        
        <center><ul>
            <li>Placing more rubbish bins around the school yard.</li>
            <li>Having schoolwide yard cleanups where everyone is involved and held accountable for picking up litter.</li>
            <li>Educate people on what them littering does to the school yard, and overall enviornment.</li>
            <li>Sell less packaged food at the school canteen.</li>
        </ul></center>
        
        <p>By taking these steps, schools can help reduce their impact on the environment and protect the health and well-being of their students and staff.</p>
